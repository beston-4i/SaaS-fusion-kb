# Knowledge Base Governance & Access Control

**Purpose:** Define strategies to centralize the SQL Knowledge Base, enforce standards through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and manage distribution.

---

## 1. Centralization Strategy

### The "Golden Source" Repository
The Knowledge Base (KB) must reside in a version-controlled **Git Repository** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This ensures:
*   **Version History:** Who changed a standard and when.
*   **Review Process:** Changes require approval via Pull Requests (PR).

---

## 2. Hybrid Distribution Strategy (Git vs AI)

### The "Source of Truth" vs. "Consumption"
*   **Git (Source of Truth):** Perfect for Control.
*   **ByteRover / Openmemory (Consumption):** Perfect for Access.

### 🚀 Recommended Architecture: The "Push" Model
1.  **Write Layer (Git):** Humans edit Markdown files. Approvals happen via PR.
2.  **Read Layer (AI Memory):** On merge, CI/CD pushes content to ByteRover.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT edit directly in ByteRover.** Treat the Memory Store as a *ReadOnly Cache* of the Git repository.

## 3. Real-World Example: "The Exchange Rate Rule"

### A. In Git (The Law)
**File:** `FINANCE/AR/AR_SQL_STANDARDS.md`
**Content:** `ALWAYS use NVL(EXCHANGE_RATE, 1)`
**Metadata:** *Author:* Sarah (Lead) | *Approver:* Mike (Finance Lead)

### B. In ByteRover (The Brain)
**Context Chunk:** "When calculating AR amounts, if the currency is functional, the exchange rate is NULL. You must use NVL(rate, 1)."
**Usage:** Agent reads this chunk to answer user questions.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Guardian / Architect** | Senior Leads | **Write (Admin)** |
| **Module Lead** | SME (e.g., Finance Lead) | **Write (Module Only)** |
| **Developer** | Report Developers | **Read Only** |

**Rule:** No merge to `main` is allowed unless approved by the Code Owner of that directory.
